Project Overview

Purpose: To apply PCA for dimensionality reduction on the Iris dataset and visualize the results in a two-dimensional scatter plot.

Dependencies: This project uses numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, containing 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features:
Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width

The dataset is categorized into three species:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica

Standardize the Data: The features are standardized to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.

Visualize the Results: The results are visualized using a scatter plot that displays the data points in the PCA-reduced space.
